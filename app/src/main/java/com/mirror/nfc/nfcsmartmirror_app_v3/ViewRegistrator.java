/**
 * Instances of this class can be added as observer to the device api. This way it will automatically detect connected mirrors and publish content on each of
 * them as soon as a mirror is available. The content to be added can be defined by the provided methods. The content always needs to be accessible, dynamic
 * content can be added by using static resources as templates and defining a set of replacements used to fill the templates.
